# New formal linguistics

## Computational modeling: A new approach to solve old problems

Alishahi, computational modeling as scientific method

## Data representation: A new take on empiricism 

The symbol grounding problem

How to model such networks? At the lexical level? Is any "deeper" representation possible? Intro to deep linguistic parsing.

## Innocent formalization

formalization is not an 'innocent' or theory-neural practice (Linell)

Grounded theory

## The Language as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) paradigm

Introductory readings on Complex Adaptive Systems and their relation to talk-in-interaction:

<a href="http://cnl.psych.cornell.edu/pubs/2009-LACAS-pos-LL.pdf">Position paper</a> by Clay Beckner, Nick C. Ellis, Richard, Blythe John Holland, Joan Bybee, Jinyun Ke, Morten H. Christiansen, Diane Larsen-Freeman, William Croft and Tom Schoenemann.

## Towards a 'latent' structuralist linguistics

Bloomfield and beyond

### On reductionism

linguistics as computational social science
beyond 'mainstream' scientific method

'mixed method' approach:
grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss)


## Remaining challenges

modeling reflexivity (recursive loops)
open system properties (i.e. language as cas) operate not only on the level of (cognitive) knowledge representation but also intersubjectively
