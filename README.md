A social scientist with a professional background in data science, I study human-human and human-technology interaction with a focus on understanding the interplay between social action and linguistic structure. I am also developing tools for voice assistants and dialog agents. I have worked on dialog flow, repair and turn design in voice technology, with a particular interest in how non-lexical utterances, disfluency and laughter can be represented in machine-readable formats. Previously, I  have also worked on the development of cognitive grammars for speech technology and NLP. <br />

<b>Research:</b> <br>
My main research interest is the study of human-human and human-technology interaction, combining qualitative approaches to the study of talk-in-interaction (conversation analysis and ethnomethodology) and speech technology design (dialog management, NLP and ASR for voice assistants). In my early-career research I have conducted linguistic fieldwork in different parts of Asia and built a video corpus of Malaysian Cantonese. My current work focuses on user experience evaluation, dialog management system design and speech recognition for non-lexical utterances. I also work as a conversation design consultant and currently write a book in this area.<br />

<br />

Most of my work has been on Chinese and English.<br />
