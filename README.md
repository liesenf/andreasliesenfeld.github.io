Welcome to the personal homepage of Andreas Liesenfeld.

I am currently a PhD candidate in linguistics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am interested in the qualitative and quantitative study of talk-in-interaction as well as in developing computational tools that model aspects of it.

My research focuses on the qualitative study of spoken discourse (interactional linguistics; pragmatics), the quantitative study of spoken discourse (corpus linguistics, grammar induction), and the development of tools that model aspects of talk-in-interaction (computational pragmatics, dialog systems).

Most of my work has been conducted on Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese). 

I have also published a corpus of spoken Chinese (MYCanCor), several tools in Computational phonetics and Chinese language processing (Cause-Chi, MV parser) and two tutorials (Conversation analytic transcription in LaTeX, Multilayed annotation with Praat).
