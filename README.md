I am a PhD candidate in linguistics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am interested in the qualitative and quantitative study of talk-in-interaction as well as in developing computational tools that model various dimensions of it.

My research focuses on the qualitative study of spoken discourse (interactional linguistics; speech act theory), the quantitative study of spoken discourse (corpus linguistics, grammar induction), and the development of tools that model aspects of talk-in-interaction (computational pragmatics, dialog systems).

Most of my work has been on Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese). 

Experiences:

PhD student in linguistics, School of Humantites and Social Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>
Data Scientist, Industry, Berlin<br>
Master, School of Social Sciences, Hong Kong University, China<br>
Bachelor, Fakultät für Geisteswissenschaften, University of Bonn, Germany

I have also published a corpus of spoken Chinese (MYCanCor), several tools in computational phonetics and Chinese language processing (Cause-Chi, MV parser) and two tutorials (Conversation analytic transcription in LaTeX, Multilayed annotation with Praat).
