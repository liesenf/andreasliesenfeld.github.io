Welcom to the personal homepage of Andreas Liesenfeld. I am currently a PhD candidate at Nanyang Technological University working in the field of computational pragmatics. I am interested in the qualitative and quantitative study of talk-in-interaction as well as in developing computational tools that model aspects of it.
My research focuses on the qualitative study of spoken discourse (conversation analysis; pragmatics), the quantitative study of spoken discourse (corpus linguistics), and the development of tools that model aspects of talk-in-interaction (computational pragmatics, dialog systems).
