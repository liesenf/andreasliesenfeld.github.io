I am currently a PhD candidate in linguistics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am interested in the study of talk and interaction with a focus on developing new methodological tools for understanding the interplay between 'linguistic' structure and action formation in mundane conversation. I am also interesting in building formal models of conversation. However, I have found this task to be so difficult, that my work in this area has to date been more of a critical engagement with existing formal models. <br />

<b>Research:</b> <br>

My main research interest is the study of social interaction, combining qualitative studies of talk-in-interaction (interactional linguistics, phonetics) with the quantitative study of corpora of spoken discourse (grammar induction). In my early-career research I have conducted linguistic fieldwork in different parts of Asia and built a video corpus of Malaysian Cantonese. Currently, I work on developing formal representations of building blocks of talk-in-interaction and the development of tools that model aspects of it (dialog systems, conversational agents).<br />

<br />

Most of my work has been on Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese).<br />
