I am a computational linguist with a professional background in data science and a passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnomethodology">ethnomethodology</a>. I write academic papers about human interaction in the tradition of conversation analysis and interactional linguistics. And I develop tools for voice assistants and dialog agents. <br />

<b>Research:</b> <br>
My main research interest is the study of human-human and human-technology interaction, combining qualitative approaches to the study of talk-in-interaction (conversation analysis and ethnomethodology) and speech technology (system design, dialog management, NLP and ASR for voice assistants). My work focuses on voice assistant design, repair and user experience evaluation, and speech recognition for laughter, disfluency and non-lexical utterances. In my early-career research I have conducted linguistic fieldwork in different parts of Asia, built a video corpus of Malaysian Cantonese, and worked on the development of cognitive grammars for speech technology and NLP. <br />

I also work as a conversation design consultant and currently write a book in this area.<br />

<br />

Most of my work has been on Chinese and English.<br />
