I am currently a PhD candidate in linguistics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am interested in the qualitative and quantitative study of talk-in-interaction as well as in developing computational tools that model various dimensions of it.<br />

<b>Research interest:</b> <br>

My research focuses on the qualitative study of spoken discourse (interactional linguistics, phonetics), the quantitative study of spoken discourse (corpus linguistics, grammar induction), and the development of tools that model aspects of talk-in-interaction (computational pragmatics, dialog systems).<br />

<br />

Most of my work has been on Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese).<br />
