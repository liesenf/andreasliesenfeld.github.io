I am currently a PhD candidate in linguistics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am interested in the qualitative and quantitative study of talk-in-interaction as well as in developing computational tools that model various dimensions of it.<br />

<br />

My research focuses on the qualitative study of spoken discourse (interactional linguistics; speech act theory), the quantitative study of spoken discourse (corpus linguistics, grammar induction), and the development of tools that model aspects of talk-in-interaction (computational pragmatics, dialog systems).<br />

<br />

Most of my work has been on Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese).<br />
