I am currently a PhD candidate in linguistics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. A linguist with a background in data science, I study talk with a focus on understanding the interplay between social action and linguistic structure. I am also developing new tools for conversational (nontask-oriented) dialog systems. I have worked on annotations of non-lexical utterances, disfluency and laughter for the application in spoken language understanding (SLU). I have also worked on the development of cognitive grammars for conversational systems, i.e. framenets and constructicons. <br />

<b>Research:</b> <br>
My main research interest is the study of talk, combining qualitative studies of talk-in-interaction (interactional linguistics, conversation analysis) with the quantitative study of corpora of spoken discourse (grammar induction, distributional modeling). In my early-career research I have conducted linguistic fieldwork in different parts of Asia and built a video corpus of Malaysian Cantonese. Currently, I work on developing corpus-based representations of building blocks of conversation as tensors. Specifically, I explore how speech corpus data can be integrated in TTR dialog parsing and management systems.<br />

<br />

Most of my work has been on Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) and English (British Englishes and World Englishes).<br />
