# Dialog management: a corpus-based method for reflexive action formation modeling

toward a method to model processes of action formation and ascription as vector space representations
Why now? Large speech corpora available

### Application in dialog systems

The aim of models of action formation with respect to dialog systems is to develop computational models of the knowledge and processes involved in the reflexive processes of formatting and ascribing actions to turn-at-talk - an essential task to human or human-like participation in the turn-taking system. 

The development of models of these processes has both theoretical and practical applications. The motivation can be to use these models as a basis for theories about human (linguistic) interaction, but it can also be the development of speech technology that emulate this kind of social conduct for various applications.

Generally speaking, the developement of speech technology in this area is guided by the following principles (Gillis et al. 2009):

problem reduction: a task is decomposed into a number of simpler substasks which can be further decomposed until subtasks are distinguished which can directly be modeled and implemented.

modularity: the program achieving a task is divided into different modules, often corresponding to major substasks, which are more or less autonomous, specialized information processors.

formalization: Within each module, a formalism is designed that puts together the necessary knowledge and methods needed for that module to accomplish its task. The respective formalism needs to capture the representation and manipulation of the specific slice of knowledge, i.e. it provides a bridge between theory and implementation. Such formalizations provide the means with which the necessary knowledge is organized in a certain way. However, this necessary step of (re)organizing the data is often problematic for a number of theoretical reasons (see section "On reductionism").
Formalization ultimately provides a means to enable inference for how the data can be used to solve the task at hand, either through 'procedual formal models' that enable direct inference based on specific instances or through 'declarative formal models' that exhibit a larger degree of separation between knowledge representation and inference aspects of a problem. Formalisms represent linguistic knowledge in various forms. In the area of grammar and linguistic structure the often take the form of state-space search models, logic-based or rule-based formalizations. In semantics the may come in form of graph-based representations such as semantic networks and frames (see section "framenets and constructicons").


### Theory testing: Computational modeling as new approach to solve old problems

Alishahi, computational modeling as scientific method





## Corpus-based representations of dialog acts

Bloomfield and beyond

### Towards a method to identify properties of 'distributional dialog acts' 







## Dialog acts a construction networks

formalization is not an 'innocent' or theory-neural practice (Linell)
Grounded theory

### Labeling dialog acts: Exploratory data analysis 

### Modeling dialog acts: vector space representations

towards a method for (1) 'comparative' and (2) 'latent' speech act analysis





## Remaining challenges

modeling reflexivity (recursive loops)
open system properties (i.e. language as cas) operate not only on the level of (cognitive) knowledge representation but also intersubjectively

### On reductionism

linguistics as computational social science
beyond 'mainstream' scientific method

'mixed method' approach:
grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss)

### The Language as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) paradigm
