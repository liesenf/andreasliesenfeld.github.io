# Dialog management: a corpus-based method for reflexive action formation modeling

toward a method to model processes of action formation and ascription as vector space representations
Why now? Large speech corpora available

### Application in dialog systems: see article 

The symbol grounding problem
How to model such networks? At the lexical level? Is any "deeper" representation possible? Intro to deep linguistic parsing.

### Theory testing: Computational modeling as new approach to solve old problems

Alishahi, computational modeling as scientific method





## Corpus-based representations of dialog acts

Bloomfield and beyond

### Towards a method to identify properties of 'distributional dialog acts' 







## Dialog acts a construction networks

formalization is not an 'innocent' or theory-neural practice (Linell)
Grounded theory

### Labeling dialog acts: Exploratory data analysis 

### Modeling dialog acts: vector space representations

towards a method for (1) 'comparative' and (2) 'latent' speech act analysis





## Remaining challenges

modeling reflexivity (recursive loops)
open system properties (i.e. language as cas) operate not only on the level of (cognitive) knowledge representation but also intersubjectively

### On reductionism

linguistics as computational social science
beyond 'mainstream' scientific method

'mixed method' approach:
grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss)

### The Language as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) paradigm

Introductory readings on Complex Adaptive Systems and their relation to talk-in-interaction:
