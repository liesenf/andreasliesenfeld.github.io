## The Malaysia Cantonese Corpus (MYCanCor)

The Malaysia Cantonese Corpus is a collection of recordings of Malaysian Cantonese speech mainly collected in Perak, Malaysia. The corpus consists of around 20 hours of video recordings of spontaneous talk-in-interaction (56 settings) typically involving 2-4 speakers. A short scene description as well as basic speaker information is provided for each recording. The corpus is transcribed in CHAT (minCHAT) format and presented in traditional Chinese characters (UTF8) using the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set (HKSCS). MYCanCor is expected to be a useful resource for researchers interested in any aspect of spoken language processing or Chinese multimodal corpora.
